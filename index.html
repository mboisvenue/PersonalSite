      <p>Hello, My name is Mike Boisvenue. I am a self-taught full stack developer.
      I became a FS developer because I was sick of my meagerly paying job
      as a manager at a medical device mill. I have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
      Bootcamp, node.js, react and jQuery. In short I should be at a
      junior developer level of knowledge as a full stack developer. I originally
      went to Full Sail university to become a game designer but had to drop out
      because of finances. I have however been able to get a game desig certificate
      and have not given up on game dev as a hobby.</p>
